# Stock Price Prediction Web App

This repository contains the code for predicting stock prices using machine learning techniques. The code is implemented in Python using various libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc. 

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is obtained from Yahoo Finance API using the `yfinance` library. It includes daily stock prices of various companies, such as Apple, Amazon, Google, etc. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to remove any missing values or outliers. 

## Models

Several machine learning models are implemented in this project to predict stock prices. These include:

- Linear Regression
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network

The models are trained on a subset of the data and tested on the remaining data to evaluate their performance. The best performing model is used to make future stock price predictions.

#  Data Accuracy Pages

The accuracy of the models is evaluated using various metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). The accuracy of each model is compared using these metrics to determine the best performing model.
